<h1>Manufacturing</h1>
<h2>Historical Context</h2>
<p> Over the past few decades, AI in the manufacturing industry has seen innovative advancements. Its original use in the late 1980s was robotics and automation, primarily focusing on streamlining manual tasks to enhance production and efficiency. These early applications centered on automating repetitive processes, such as part-handling and sorting.</p>
<p>Advancing into the 1990s, AI technology took a leap forward, introducing more sophisticated algorithms and robotics control systems that revolutionized decision-making capabilities. This led to greater customization of industrial machines, lowering production costs, and empowering manufacturers to boost output while maintaining quality. The integration of AI-driven monitoring systems further improved precision and quality control during production cycles.</p>
<p>Currently, AI technology continues to advance, marked by cutting-edge sensors for autonomous vehicles and advanced predictive analytics. These developments enable manufacturers to extract invaluable insights from accumulated data, optimizing operations for utmost efficiency without compromising safety standards for both workers and consumers. Moreover, researchers are exploring Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), aiming to create machines that possess human-like problem-solving abilities. </p>
<h2>Impacts of AI Implementation</h2>
<h3>Efficiency</h3>
<p>Rather than people doing manual labor, AI-enabled robots automate production processes, without the need for human supervision or interaction. Productivity is boosted, as automated machines work around the clock to maximize output while minimizing costs associated with labor and production time. </p>
<h3>Product Quality</h3>
<p>Based on complex data analysis, machines in the industrial environment can make decisions by themselves, meaning they can identify problems with higher accuracy compared to humans. This ensures quality control since AI can detect aberrant results very quickly.</p>

    <h2>Current Trends</h2>
<p>In semiconductor manufacturing, AI has enabled advanced process control solutions for more precise and effective yield management from chip designs. In steelmaking, artificial neural network techniques monitor and optimize production processes. Additionally, AI solutions can be implemented in ironmaking stages such as smelting and casting, where temperature control is critical for obtaining desired output grades of steel alloys. Finally, renewable energy sources such as solar panels rely heavily on AI-based predictive analysis systems to maximize energy conversion rates while minimizing waste material generated. </p>
<p>2/3 of manufacturers using AI in routine business operations indicated their reliance on the technology is growing. The market for artificial intelligence in manufacturing is estimated to be worth USD 2.3 billion in 2022 and USD 16.3 billion in 2027, rising at a CAGR of 47.9%. The market is anticipated to expand due to growing consumer demand for AI chipsets with increased computational power.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the reliance of AI is apparent in the various sectors of the manufactoring industry (see right). The graph refers to the extent to which AI technologies are integrated and utilized in routine or everyday activities within a specific context, and indicates the level of reliance on AI-driven solutions to perform various tasks and functions on a regular basis, enhancing efficiency, productivity, and decision-making processes. Our data indicates that AI is not just sporadically used for specialized tasks but has become an integral and essential part of the daily workflow and operations within the manufacturing industry.</p>
