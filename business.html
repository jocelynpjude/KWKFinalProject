<h3>The advancement and usage of AI in the business sector have been significant, leading to transformative changes in various industries. Provided below, is an overview of the advancements and usage of AI in business, particularly in terms of job automation, supported by data and examples:

<h4>Early Adoption of AI in Business (Before 2010)</h4>

Before 2010, AI in the business sector was primarily used for basic automation tasks and data analysis.
AI applications were limited and mainly focused on improving efficiency and decision-making processes.<br><br>
<h4>AI-Driven Customer Service (2010s)</h4>

In the 2010s, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants became prevalent in customer service operations.
Chatbots were integrated into websites, mobile apps, and social media platforms to handle customer inquiries and provide support 24/7.
This advancement improved customer experiences and reduced the need for human customer support agents for routine queries.<br><br>
<h4>Automation of Routine Tasks (2010s)</h4>

AI has been used to automate routine and repetitive tasks in various industries, such as data entry, accounting, and logistics.
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools, powered by AI, can handle mundane tasks, leading to increased efficiency and reduced operational costs.<br><br>
<h4>AI in Supply Chain and Logistics (2010s)</h4>

AI algorithms can analyze consumer behavior and preferences to target the right audience with relevant content, improving the overall effectiveness of marketing efforts.<br><br>
<h4>Job Automation Concerns (2010s-2020s)</h4>

The increased adoption of AI and automation in the business sector has raised concerns about job displacement.
Studies, such as the one conducted by McKinsey in 2017, have estimated that between 400 to 800 million jobs worldwide could be automated by 2030.
